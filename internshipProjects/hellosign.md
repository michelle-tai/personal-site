## TL;DR

- Streamlined the editing process for e-signature templates to be **~75% faster** for customers in HelloSign’s Salesforce integration so that users were no longer forced to manually recreate templates they wanted to edit.
- Saved **$240,000** in annual recurring revenue for the company and reached team’s quarterly goal.
- Implemented remapping of signer-associated fields in Apex, wrote unit tests, and worked with PHP and API endpoints.
